Deribit Trading System

The Deribit Trading System is a custom-built C++ application designed for real-time cryptocurrency trading on the Deribit exchange’s testnet. This project integrates with Deribit’s API to facilitate essential trading functions, such as account authentication, order placement, and order cancellation, within a low-latency environment optimized for macOS.

Key Features:

Authentication & Security: Connects securely to the Deribit API using OAuth2 authentication. Client credentials are securely transmitted and handled to ensure authorized access to trading operations.

Order Management: Provides robust functionalities for placing and managing buy and sell orders. Users can specify instrument names, quantities, and prices, while the system efficiently interacts with the exchange's endpoints.

WebSocket Integration: Establishes a WebSocket connection for real-time market data streaming and order status updates, allowing the application to respond quickly to market changes.

Error Handling & Debugging: Includes mechanisms to parse API responses, handle errors, and provide detailed output for debugging. This ensures smooth trading operations and simplifies troubleshooting.

Technical Overview:

Tech Stack: C++ (for high-performance, low-latency execution), libcurl (for HTTP requests), and WebSockets.
Platform: macOS, leveraging its native libraries to achieve optimized execution.
Application of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST): Rules for user eligibility and trading conditions can be implemented using AST for flexible conditional handling.
This project is intended as a reliable and scalable foundation for automated cryptocurrency trading on Deribit, supporting low-latency trading operations ideal for high-frequency and algorithmic trading use cases.
